The most important elements in this application are: 

- Create an HTML5
- Stablish the events inside the website
- Generate the Java Script with every element needed: (i) Variables; (ii) tbody elements; (iii) select buttons and handlers (listeners), and (iv) functions for filtering and reset page.
