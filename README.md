Dynamic Table with Java Script 

The result is available at https://rodguarneros.github.io/javascript-challenge/ 

This project is a friendly way of organizing and publishing a data collection in a dynamic website, based on java script programming languange (79.2%), css (11.4%) and html (9.4%). 

The most important elements in this application are: 

- Create an HTML5
- Use D3.js
- Collect Document Objects Models from a Form
- Stablish the events inside the website
- Generate the Java Script with every element needed: (i) Variables; (ii) tbody elements; (iii) select buttons and handlers (listeners to trigger the events), and (iv) functions for filtering and reset page.

Table data and filters are visualized like this:
